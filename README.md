# Welcome

this page covers stuff that aoi.js docs manager doesn't mention about it, feel free to browse stuff around here, this is currently unfinished for now

{% hint style="info" %}
the code examples shown below on the available guides are likely using command handler method but you can add the codes to non command handler methods if you don't like command handlers for some reason
{% endhint %}

## why this exists

mainly but mostly many reasons but i will only cover these:

1. lack of explanations in official docs of aoi.js
2. reduce the repetitive of questions of stuff like button pages, slash choices, etc
3. there are some features but wasn't covered in official docs of aoi.js for some unknown reason
4. an attempt to help developers to make their development easier with aoi
5. some stuff are outdated in the official doc of aoi.js, so you then go to support but what's worse?, imagine being in support and you ended up getting ignored because your question was now lost in chat because it was filled along with other questions by random people in the channel and still waiting for days but still ignored
